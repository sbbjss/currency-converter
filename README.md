# Currency Conversion Tool

## Project Overview
This project involved the creation of a simple full-stack application using NestJS for the backend and Nuxt for the frontend. The goal was to build a tool that retrieves and converts the amount of a specified transaction from one currency to a selected currency using a mock database. This task demonstrates ability to work with both frontend and backend technologies, apply RESTful principles, and implement clean, scalable code.

## How to Run
To run the project, make sure that ports 3000 and 3001 are available and execute the following command in the root directory:

```makefile
make start
```
Alternatively, you can manually run the backend and frontend by using relevant commands specified in respective package.json files.
For manual boot, remember to install dependencies for each application by running `npm install` in `backend/services/transactions` and `frontend/currency-converter`.
